# marrel.css
Marrel is the CSS as (soon to be) used on Inktweb.nl. This toolkit contains the components we most commonly use in our websites. This prevents us from writing new CSS or copy/pasting in things like `<form>` styling and `buttons`. Thus creating a more uniform design across our sites and making it easier for others to use and improve the code.

This is heavily inspired by Github's [Primer](https://github.com/primer/primer) and @mdo's talk [Build your own Bootstrap](https://speakerdeck.com/mdo/build-your-own-bootstrap). As a way to give back (and as a *thank you*) this code has been released open-source under the MIT license.

The name comes from an abbreviation from **Mar**gin **Rel**ease. A `btn` often found on typewriters which allows you to write on the margins of a page.

## How does it work?
Marrel is built with Sass on top of the grid system from Bootstrap (via [Bootstrip](https://github.com/MartijnOud/bootstrip)) and [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).

The end goal is not to create a toolkit that works for every use case but instead provides a solid starting point. Therefore the code does not contain twenty table styles and ten button sizes. Still — when using this we encourage you to write as few new lines of CSS as possible and opt for *less is more*.

# Getting started

Include the following files:
````
<link rel=“stylesheet” href=“//www.inktweb.nl/includes/marrel/marrel.min.css”>
<script src=“//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js”></script>
<script src=“//www.inktweb.nl/includes/marrel/marrel.js”></script>

````
**(the .js files are only needed if you want the `hamburger-menu`)**

Documentation can be found at [https://marrel.inktweb.nl/](https://marrel.inktweb.nl/).

# Building
You'll need Sass installed. Plop the following line in your terminal to make changes to the SCSS file. 
````
sass --watch scss/marrel.scss:marrel.min.css --style compressed
````

Still in development -- alpha version -- so no version numbering yet.
